description: First performed in 1910, Deirdre of the Sorrows is based on Irish mythology.
  It was unfinished at time of the author's death and completed by the poet William
  Butler Yeats and Synge's fianc e, the actress Molly Allgood. Deirdre, a beautiful
  young woman, is desired by a powerful but older king, Conchubor, whose pursuit of
  her leads to tragedy.
